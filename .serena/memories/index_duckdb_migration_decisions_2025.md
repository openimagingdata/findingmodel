2025-10-08 update: Implemented DuckDB directory ingestion. update_from_directory now hashes *.fm.json files, stages filename/hash pairs in a temp table, runs a full outer join vs finding_models, and builds batch inserts/updates/deletes. It drops FTS/HNSW indexes once, applies executemany batches for core and denormalized tables, then rebuilds indexes. Per-file helpers remain but no longer drive ingestion.
