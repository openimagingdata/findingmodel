# Index DuckDB Migration Status - 2025-10-09

## Overview
Two-phase approach to migrate Index from MongoDB to DuckDB with hybrid search:
- **Phase 1** (current): Technology migration - get DuckDB implementation working and tested
- **Phase 2** (future): Architectural refactoring - decompose both MongoDB and DuckDB into 5 focused classes

## Phase 1 Status: 70% Complete

### Implementation: src/findingmodel/duckdb_index.py
- **Size**: 1,319 lines, 47 methods (monolithic - acceptable for Phase 1)
- **Pattern**: Same "god object" as MongoDB Index (will be refactored in Phase 2)

### What's Done ✅
- Complete schema with 8 tables (finding_models + 7 denormalized tables)
- Core CRUD operations (get, contains, add_or_update_entry_from_file, remove_entry)
- Hybrid search (exact match → FTS + semantic → weighted fusion)
- Batch directory ingestion with hash-based diffing (update_from_directory)
- Drop/rebuild HNSW strategy (no experimental persistence - safer)
- Separate model_people and model_organizations junction tables
- DuckDB utilities extracted to tools/duckdb_utils.py
- Read-only mode by default (explicit writable for updates)
- Enhanced logging for batch operations

### What's Missing ❌
**Code gaps:**
- search_batch() method (batch embedding optimization)
- Tag filtering in search() (schema supports it, not implemented)
- _validate_model() implementation (currently a stub)

**Test coverage:**
- Only 4 tests in test/test_duckdb_index.py vs 34 in MongoDB Index
- No tests for update_from_directory batch logic
- No tests for denormalized table integrity
- No performance benchmarks

**Integration:**
- MongoDB Index still in use (src/findingmodel/index.py)
- Config still has MongoDB settings
- CLI commands not tested with DuckDB

## Phase 1 Completion Steps

1. **Implement missing features**: search_batch(), tag filtering, validate_model()
2. **Port all tests**: 34 MongoDB tests + DuckDB-specific tests (40+ total)
3. **OPTIONAL**: Basic 2-class decomposition (read/write split OR search/data split)
4. **Replace MongoDB Index**: Rename files, update config, mark MongoDB deps optional
5. **Integration testing**: CLI, notebooks, performance benchmarks

**Deliverable**: Working DuckDB Index with hybrid search, comprehensive tests, ready to merge

## Phase 2 Plan (Future)

Full decomposition of BOTH MongoDB and DuckDB implementations:
- 5 focused classes: Repository (protocol-based), Validator, FileManager, SearchEngine, Facade
- Shared abstractions with backend-specific implementations
- See tasks/refactoring/01-index-decomposition.md

## Key Decisions

**Why monolithic code is OK for Phase 1:**
1. Validate technology choice (DuckDB hybrid search) first
2. Get user feedback on semantic search, hybrid weights, tag filtering
3. Reduce risk - don't combine tech migration + architecture refactoring
4. Ship value faster
5. Refactor with confidence once working end-to-end

**Why Phase 2 is separate:**
- Applies to BOTH backends (MongoDB and DuckDB)
- Larger effort requiring protocol-based abstraction
- Can learn from Phase 1 experience
- Should not block shipping better search capability
