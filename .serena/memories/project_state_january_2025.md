- No ruff errors or warnings
- Proper type annotations throughout
- Consistent code formatting

### ✅ Documentation
- README.md accurately describes all tools
- CLAUDE.md correctly documents project structure
- All code examples verified and working
- Comprehensive async/await patterns demonstrated

## Recent Major Improvements

### Test Suite Enhancements
1. **Search functionality**: 11 comprehensive tests for Index.search()
2. **AI integration**: 7 tests with @pytest.mark.callout for external APIs
3. **Error handling**: 15 tests for network/MongoDB failures
4. **find_similar_models**: 3 tests including integration scenarios

### Documentation Fixes
