# Documentation Corrections - January 2025

## Overview
Critical documentation errors were identified and corrected on 2025-01-14 to ensure accuracy with actual implementations.

## Major Corrections

### 1. Index Class Documentation
**Files updated:** CLAUDE.md, README.md

**Incorrect (before):**
- Described as using JSONL files for storage
- Said it creates/maintains an `index.jsonl` file
- Described as file-based indexing

**Correct (after):**
- Uses MongoDB for storage and indexing
- Manages collections for finding models, people, and organizations
- Provides full-text search via MongoDB text indexes
- Supports batch operations for directory synchronization

### 2. find_similar_models() Function
**File updated:** README.md

**Incorrect (before):**
```python
# Wrong signature and behavior
similar = await find_similar_models(
    reference_model,  # Wrong: doesn't take model objects
    models,          # Wrong: doesn't take model list
    top_n=2         # Wrong: no such parameter
)
# Returns list of tuples (wrong)
```

**Correct (after):**
```python
# Actual signature and behavior
analysis = await find_similar_models(
    finding_name="pneumothorax",
    description="...",
    synonyms=["PTX"],
    index=index  # Optional MongoDB index
)
# Returns SimilarModelAnalysis object with:
# - recommendation: "edit_existing", "create_new", or "review_needed"
# - confidence: float
# - similar_models: list of SearchResult objects
```

**Key differences:**
- Takes finding name/description, not model objects
- Searches existing models in database, not comparing provided models
- Returns analysis object with recommendations, not similarity scores
- Uses AI agents for intelligent search and analysis
- Purpose is to prevent duplicate models, not general similarity

### 3. Enhanced Code Examples
**All README.md examples updated with:**
- Proper async/await patterns using `asyncio.run()`
- Expected output demonstrations
- Error handling examples
- Import statements included
- Comments explaining behavior

## Impact
These corrections ensure users understand:
1. MongoDB is required for the Index class
2. find_similar_models() is for duplicate prevention, not model comparison
3. Proper async patterns for all tools
4. Actual return types and data structures

## Verification
All code examples in documentation have been verified against actual implementations in:
- src/findingmodel/index.py
- src/findingmodel/tools/similar_finding_models.py
- Test files confirm actual behavior
