"""Integration tests for manifest pattern in DuckDB index downloads.

These tests verify that DuckDBIndex properly uses fetch_manifest() to get
database URLs/hashes instead of relying on hardcoded config defaults.

Per manifest_integration_bugfix_plan.md, Task 1.1 tests are designed to verify
the manifest integration is working. Task 1.2 verifies schema compatibility.

NOTE: DuckDBIndex.__init__ was already fixed in the plan (line 219 has manifest_key).
This test validates that fix is working correctly and demonstrates the pattern
that needs to be applied to the remaining 5 call sites.
