## [0.2.0] â€“ 2025-06-23

### Added

- Added facility to check on online `ids.json` structure (e.g., from a GitHub repo) to help avoid
  duplicate IDs as much as possible.
- Started doing logging with `loguru`

### Changed

- Refactored `tools` to be its own sub-module, making it easier to pull in tools
- Redid `Index` to now use a MongoDB backend, which can be either local or remote
- Fixed code field length minimum to be 2 characters

### Removed

- ðŸ”´ Removed `SearchRepository`â€”this is going to be delivered directly via `Index`.

## [0.1.4] â€“ 2025-05-08

### Added

- Added new `Person` and `Organization` classes to represent contributors to a finding model, and added
  a (non-requiredâ€”yet) list of them to `FindingModelFull` as the `contributors` field.
- Added an `Index` object that can maintain an in-memory database of the metadata of finding models
  saved as `*.fm.json` in a given directory.
- Added a `SearchRepo` object that has a LanceDB-based hybrid search facility allowing for more
  sophisticated analysis of finding models for potential similarity.
- Lots of tests and test data to prevent regressions, and updating docs and notebooks.

### Changed

- Changed the way the `tools` module is imported; probably want to use `import findingmodel.tools as fmtools` or something similar.
