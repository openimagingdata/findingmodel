All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **BioOntology API Integration**: Added support for BioOntology.org REST API search
  - Access to 800+ medical ontologies including SNOMED-CT, ICD-10, LOINC, and more
  - Semantic type filtering for targeted searches
  - Pagination support for comprehensive results
  - Async/await implementation with connection pooling via httpx
- **Protocol-Based Ontology Search Architecture**: Flexible backend support system
  - `OntologySearchProtocol` defines standard interface for search providers
  - Auto-detection of available backends based on configuration
  - Parallel execution of multiple backends using `asyncio.gather`
  - Clean abstraction allows easy addition of new search providers

### Changed

- **Renamed `search_ontology_concepts()` to `match_ontology_concepts()`**: Better reflects the matching/categorization functionality
- **Multi-Backend Support**: Function now automatically uses all configured backends
  - Searches LanceDB and/or BioOntology in parallel based on configuration
  - Merges and deduplicates results from multiple sources
  - Maintains high performance with parallel execution
- **Improved Test Infrastructure**: Enhanced test patterns and organization
  - Added `test_ontology_search.py` for Protocol compliance testing
  - Proper SecretStr handling in tests
  - Fixed all linting errors with proper type annotations
  - Configured per-file ignores for test-specific patterns (ANN401 for mock functions)

### Fixed

- **SecretStr Handling**: Fixed improper use of `str(SecretStr)` which doesn't extract the actual secret value
  - BioOntologySearchClient now handles SecretStr extraction internally
  - Tests properly mock SecretStr values
- **Linting Compliance**: Fixed 33 linting errors to achieve clean `task check`
  - Combined nested `with` statements using parenthesized form (SIM117)
  - Added proper type annotations throughout test files
  - Removed `async` from functions that don't use `await` (RUF029)
  - Fixed indentation issues in test files

## [0.3.3] - 2025-09-04

### Added

- **Ontology Concept Search Tool**: New high-performance tool for searching medical ontologies
  - Refactored from 70+ second searches to ~10 second searches using optimized architecture
  - Uses programmatic query generation instead of LLM-based search for better performance
  - Implements post-processing to guarantee exact match detection
  - Proper Pydantic AI patterns with structured output validation
  - Demo script in `notebooks/demo_ontology_concept_search.py`
- **Added `anatomic_locations` to `FindingModelFull`**: Can now specify a list of index codes that 
specifically refer to anatomy to indicate where the finding is likely to occur.
- **Anatomic Location Search Tool**: New two-agent Pydantic AI tool for finding anatomic locations
  - Reusable `OntologySearchClient` for LanceDB medical terminology search
  - `OntologySearchResult` model for standardized ontology search responses
  - Two-agent architecture: search agent (generates queries) + matching agent (selects best locations)
  - Hybrid search across multiple ontology tables (anatomic_locations, radlex, snomedct)
  - Production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and connection lifecycle management
  - Demo script in `notebooks/demo_anatomic_location_search.py`
- **Testing Improvements**: Enhanced testing infrastructure following Pydantic AI best practices
  - Added API call prevention guards (`models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False`) to prevent accidental API calls during testing
  - Implemented proper Pydantic AI testing patterns using `TestModel` and `FunctionModel`
  - Consolidated related component tests (merged ontology_search tests into anatomic_location_search tests)
  - Fixed pytest collection issues by moving demo scripts to `notebooks/` directory
  - Added `testpaths = ["test"]` to pyproject.toml to restrict pytest scope

### Changed

- **Refactored `get_openai_model()`**: Moved from `similar_finding_models.py` to `common.py` for reusability
- **Test Philosophy**: Shifted from testing library functionality to testing actual code behavior and workflow logic
- **Project Conventions**: Established convention for demo scripts in `notebooks/` with `demo_*.py` naming
- **Test Framework Consistency**: Converted all tests from unittest.TestCase to pure pytest style for consistency
- **Ontology Concept Search Refactoring**: Major performance and architecture improvements
  - Replaced manual retry loops with Pydantic AI's built-in validation patterns
  - Simplified from 3 agents to 1 agent plus programmatic processing for 85% performance improvement
  - Changed from transformation in validators to proper post-processing functions
  - Improved text normalization to only remove trailing parenthetical content

### Fixed

- Fixed integration test API blocking issue where `models.ALLOW_MODEL_REQUESTS = False` was preventing integration tests from running
- Resolved all linting errors in test files (import order, nested with statements, unused variables)
- Fixed normalize_concept function to preserve middle parenthetical content (e.g., "Calcium (2+) level")
- Corrected Pydantic AI anti-patterns where output validators were transforming data instead of validating
- Fixed test organization by consolidating test_query_generator.py into test_ontology_concept_search.py
- Cleaned up 110+ linting errors by removing temporary debug files and fixing type annotations

  - Implemented batch MongoDB queries to reduce round trips
  - Added lightweight term generation with intelligent fallback to full models

### Added

- Added new `Person` and `Organization` classes to represent contributors to a finding model, and added
  a (non-requiredâ€”yet) list of them to `FindingModelFull` as the `contributors` field.
- Added an `Index` object that can maintain an in-memory database of the metadata of finding models
  saved as `*.fm.json` in a given directory.
- Added a `SearchRepo` object that has a LanceDB-based hybrid search facility allowing for more
  sophisticated analysis of finding models for potential similarity.
- Lots of tests and test data to prevent regressions, and updating docs and notebooks.

### Changed

- Changed the way the `tools` module is imported; probably want to use `import findingmodel.tools as fmtools` or something similar.
