and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased (presumed 0.5.0)]

### Added

- **Enhanced Index API Methods** - Complete pagination and search capabilities without breaking abstraction:
  - `list(limit, offset, order_by, order_dir)` - Paginated browsing of all finding models
  - `search_by_slug(pattern, match_type, limit, offset)` - Pattern-based search with relevance ranking
  - `count()` and `count_search()` - Efficient counting for pagination UI
  - `get_full(oifm_id)` and `get_full_batch(oifm_ids)` - Retrieve complete FindingModelFull objects
- **Manifest-Based Database Downloads** - Runtime database version discovery:
  - Databases auto-update from remote manifest.json (no library release needed)
  - Graceful fallback to direct URL/hash for offline scenarios
  - CLI command: `db-info` to check database versions and status
- **Self-Contained Databases** - Full JSON storage in DuckDB:
  - Single .duckdb file contains metadata + embeddings + full JSON models
  - Separate `finding_model_json` table with automatic compression
  - No external JSONL files needed
- **Local ID Generation** - Database-backed OIFM/OIFMA ID generation:
  - `generate_next_id(source)` - Random generation with collision checking
  - `generate_attribute_id(model_oifm_id, source)` - Attribute ID generation with source inference
  - No GitHub dependency, thread-safe via DuckDB
  - Prevents ID collisions when multiple users independently create models

### Changed

- **Index schema**: Added separate `finding_model_json` table for blob storage
- **Index schema**: Added index on `slug_name` for efficient LIKE queries
- **Code organization**: Shared helper methods eliminate duplication in list/search/count operations

### Deprecated

- Direct access to `Index._ensure_connection()` - use new API methods instead (see migration guide)
- GitHub-based ID generation (`tools/add_ids.py`) - replaced by Index-based generation

### Fixed

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-20

### Added

- **DuckDB Index Backend**: High-performance local search with HNSW vector indexing, now the default
  - Automatic download of pre-built database files on first use (via Pooch with SHA256 verification)
  - Platform-native file storage using platformdirs (OS-appropriate cache/data directories)
  - Base contributors (4 people, 7 organizations) automatically loaded in new databases
  - Optional remote database URLs configurable via environment variables
  - Utilities for building/updating databases from directories of FM definitions
- **Anatomic Locations**: Comprehensive support for anatomic location finding and management
  - New `anatomic_locations` field in `FindingModelFull` for specifying anatomic index codes
  - Two-agent AI search tool across anatomic_locations, RadLex, and SNOMED CT ontologies
  - CLI commands for building, validating, and viewing statistics on anatomic location databases
  - Demo: `notebooks/demo_anatomic_location_search.py`
- **Ontology Concept Search Tool**: High-performance medical concept search
  - Multi-backend support: DuckDB vector search and BioOntology.org REST API (requires `BIOONTOLOGY_API_KEY`)
  - Protocol-based architecture for pluggable search backends
  - Demo: `notebooks/demo_ontology_concept_match.py`
- **Finding Model Editor Tool**: AI-assisted interactive editor with markdown and natural language workflows
- **Index API enhancements**:
  - `get_people()` method to retrieve all people from Index (sorted by name)
  - `get_organizations()` method to retrieve all organizations from Index (sorted by name)
  - Available in both DuckDBIndex and MongoDBIndex implementations
- **Documentation**: New `docs/database-management.md` guide for maintainers covering database operations, CLI commands, and write-mode Python API

### Changed

- **DuckDB is now the default index backend** (MongoDB deprecated but still available via `[mongodb]` extra)
- **Database file locations**: Files now stored in platform-native directories
  - Auto-download mitigates migration: databases automatically download to new locations on first use
- **Test suite reorganization**: Reduced from 17 to 12 test files, grouped by feature area
- **Documentation restructure**: README.md now focuses on user perspective (read-only Index operations), with maintainer/write operations moved to docs/database-management.md

### Deprecated

- **MongoDB backend**: Still functional via `pip install findingmodel[mongodb]` but no longer the default
  - DuckDB provides better performance and simpler deployment
  - MongoDB configuration commented out in config but available if needed

### Removed

- **LanceDB dependency**: Replaced by DuckDB for better performance and consistency

### Migration Notes

Upgrading from v0.3.x:

- **For most users**: No action required. Databases will auto-download to platform-native locations on first use.
- **If using MongoDB**: Your MongoDB index will continue to work, but consider migrating to DuckDB for better performance. Use `index build` CLI to create DuckDB index from your finding model definitions.
- **If using custom database paths**: Note that default paths have changed to platform-native directories. You can continue using custom paths via CLI `--index` / `--db-path` options.

## [0.2.0] â€“ 2025-06-23

### Added

- Added facility to check on online `ids.json` structure (e.g., from a GitHub repo) to help avoid
  duplicate IDs as much as possible.

## [0.1.4] â€“ 2025-05-08

### Added

- Added new `Person` and `Organization` classes to represent contributors to a finding model, and added
  a (non-requiredâ€”yet) list of them to `FindingModelFull` as the `contributors` field.
- Added an `Index` object that can maintain an in-memory database of the metadata of finding models
  saved as `*.fm.json` in a given directory.
- Added a `SearchRepo` object that has a LanceDB-based hybrid search facility allowing for more
  sophisticated analysis of finding models for potential similarity.
- Lots of tests and test data to prevent regressions, and updating docs and notebooks.

### Changed

- Changed the way the `tools` module is imported; probably want to use `import findingmodel.tools as fmtools` or something similar.

### Removed

- Removed `SearchRepository` and associated testing/test files.
