# Feature Specification: AI-Based Finding Model Editor

**Feature Branch**: `001-ai-based-finding`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need an AI-based finding model edit tool with two modes: natural language commands and markdown-based editing"

---

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
Medical professionals and researchers need to modify existing finding models by adding new attributes, updating choice values, or refining descriptions while preserving the integrity of existing IDs and maintaining clinical accuracy.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a finding model with existing attributes, **When** user provides natural language command "add severity attribute with mild, moderate, severe options", **Then** system adds new ChoiceAttribute with generated IDs while preserving existing model structure
2. **Given** a finding model exported to markdown format, **When** user edits markdown to add new choice values and updates descriptions, **Then** system applies only the valid changes while preserving existing IDs
3. **Given** an invalid edit request that would change clinical meaning, **When** user attempts to rename "pneumothorax" to "lung collapse", **Then** system rejects the change and explains why it's not semantically equivalent
4. **Given** a finding model with choice attributes, **When** user adds new values to existing choice attributes, **Then** system generates new value IDs while maintaining existing value-to-ID mappings

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user requests changes that would break ID integrity?
- How does system handle conflicting or ambiguous natural language commands?
- What happens when markdown edits contain both valid and invalid changes?
- How does system preserve clinical accuracy when interpreting user edits?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements (Minimal Plan)
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a natural language command interface for finding model editing
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a markdown-based editing interface for finding model modification
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all existing OIFM IDs (model, attribute, and value IDs) during edits
- **FR-004**: System MUST only allow addition of new attributes and choice values
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow modification of descriptive text that preserves clinical meaning
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow renaming of terms ONLY when semantic meaning remains unchanged
- **FR-007**: System MUST reject changes that would alter clinical meaning or break ID mappings
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate valid OIFM IDs for newly added attributes and values
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear feedback when rejecting invalid changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST export finding models to editable markdown format
- **FR-011**: System MUST parse markdown changes and apply valid modifications

### Key Entities (Minimal Plan)
- **FindingModel**: The model being edited, with all OIFM IDs preserved
- **Natural Language Command**: User instruction for adding attributes, values, or editing descriptions
- **Markdown Representation**: Editable markdown version of the model's attributes
- **ModelChange**: Addition or safe modification (description/rename) to the model
