description: Assess plan file for clarity, completeness, and alignment with best practices
mode: agent
---
Please assess the specified plan file ${file}:
- Does it make clear what the goals of the overall plan are with clear deliverables?
- Does it break the work down into clear, circumscribed, manageable steps with specific boundaries and goals which can be assessed independently?
- Will we be able to assess how well we've completed each step after implementation?
- After completing all the steps, will we have met the goals we set out for--and will those goals let us take the next steps we need?

Regarding the approach:
  - Is it aligned with our coding standards and practices?
  - Is the approach outlined the most straightforward, or are we over-engineering? We shouldn't implement stuff we're not going to need, and if we're in doubt, we should assume we're not going to need it.
  - Are we using CURRENT best practices? YOU NEED TO CHECK a perplexity/ref/web search and consult up-to-date docs with ref to make sure about this.

Please call out any ambiguities you find and list them under NEEDS CLARIFICATION.
Please especially identify anything you think is a critical issue that would block us from proceeding.
If you have less urgent suggestions for improvement, please list them as well.
